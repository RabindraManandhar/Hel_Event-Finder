ABOUT THIS PROJECT

This react project is an app to search for events in Helsinki region. It uses events API from Helsinki Open API.

I have used React-Google-Maps for this project. I have also used geolocation in it.

I have used React-Router to give a feel of multiple pages.

I have also used React-Select create search bar with suggestions for all the events from the API data.
